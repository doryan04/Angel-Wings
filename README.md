# Angel-Wings (by [@ItzAdel](https://github.com/ItzAdel) and [@nm17](https://github.com/nm17))

Angel Wings is a ergo-keyboard with 46 keys, originally designed for a school project.

You can "handwire" it or order a pcb using the files. Everything you need for it is available in the [`scheme_and_parts` folder](https://github.com/ItzAdel/Angel-Wings/tree/master/scheme_and_parts).

Currently work in progress, some things might be missing from the repo. Make sure to [leave an issue](https://github.com/ItzAdel/Angel-Wings/issues/new) in case of any problems.
